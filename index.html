            <h1> About</h1>
            <p> This is an online interactive experience exploring how Khaleeji heritage is presented across various
                locations on Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi, UAE. This website is built from scratch and it exhibits
                Khaleeji heritage at the following locations: Manarat Al Saadiyat, Louvre Abu Dhabi, and NYU Abu Dhabi.
                The goal of this project is to depict the essence of ethnography for users by taking them on a
                mesmerizing journey that provides them with the chance to see and hear for themselves aspects that
                represent Khaleeji heritage in its raw form. It allows them to take part in the amazing cultural
                experience of Khaleeji heritage regardless of geographical boundaries. The website’s purpose is not to
                be a form of a virtual exhibition of the Khaleeji heritage on its own but to share our own narratives by
                portraying what we heard and saw. The creation of the website and the works displayed are based on
                ethnographic research conducted by Alia Waleed and Umair Shah and are specific to May-June 2022 as some
                of the shown aspects were specifically exhibited during this period.
            </p>
            <p>The motivation for this artwork stems from our own lack of knowledge of the Khaleeji heritage prior to
                taking this course. Although we are living in the UAE, we were hardly aware of places that represented
                the Khaleeji heritage. Through the duration of this course, we became acquainted with numerous sources
                and representations of Khaleeji heritage on Saadiyat Island itself, and so we realized that the
                treasures of Khaleeji heritage are not as far from us as we assumed them to be rather they are merely
                under-explored. Driven by the motive to make Khaleeji heritage more accessible and apparent in the
                cultural paradigm, we created this audio-visual website. The purpose of this website, as stated above,
                is to make the Khaleeji heritage more accessible to others by sharing our own experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the duration of our course, “Engaging Khaleeji Musical Heritage: An Introduction to Applied
                Ethnomusicology”, we not only read engaging texts pertinent to ethnography, Khaleeji music, and
                heritage, but we also had the luxury of visiting esteemed places like the Louvre Abu Dhabi to experience
                this heritage on our own, leaving room for interpretations as we did not have a tour guide. Therefore,
                we believe that it would be beneficial if we convey a more holistic and sensory experience to our
                audience as well. Using an audio-visual approach on the website helps us make the experience of
                interacting with the Khaleeji heritage more immersive and inspirational as the audience is exposed to
                multiple stimuli as opposed to only being exposed to one stimulus [for example, as opposed to merely
                just reading about the heritage].

            </p>
            <p>
                As we previously mentioned, the website does not serve as a virtual exhibition rather it is the
                depiction of the Khaleeji heritage through our lens. All the videos and audio media on the website are
                taken directly by us and therefore represent our perspective of the Khaleeji heritage experience i.e.
                what we saw and what we heard. This opens the floor to interpretation as the audience can then
                experience the heritage through our lens yet form their backgrounds and perspectives of their own.
