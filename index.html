            <h1> About</h1>
            <p> For the final project, we aim to create an online interactive experience exploring how Khaleeji heritage
                is presented across various locations on Saadiyat Island. We will be building a website from scratch
                that exhibits Khaleeji heritage at the following locations: Manarat Al Saadiyat, Louvre Abu Dhabi, and
                NYU Abu Dhabi. The goal of this project is to depict the essence of ethnography for users by taking them
                on a journey that provides them with the chance to see and hear aspects that represent Khaleeji
                heritage, allowing them to take part in the cultural experience regardless of geographical boundaries.
                The website’s purpose is not to be a form of a virtual exhibition but to share our own narratives by
                portraying what we heard and saw. The creation of the website and the works displayed are based on
                ethnographic research conducted by Alia and Umair and are specific to May-June 2022 as some of the shown
                aspects were specifically exhibited during this period. </p>
            <p>The landing page of the website will display a map of Saadiyat Island with the specific locations that
                could be explored alongside a small introduction and instructions on how to navigate the page. Depending
                on the users’ choice when clicking on the map, they will be redirected to a page with the respective
                location and works representing Khaleeji heritage. In Manarat Al Saadiyat, the user would first be
                presented with a bird view map of the rooms in the “Zemanna Exhibition” that allows for the visual
                exploration of memories from the 1990s in the UAE based on the artists’ interpretations. The user could
                then click on the room that they want to explore and would be presented with an image that they could
                hover over if they choose to listen to the audio of the installation. In Louvre Abu Dhabi, the user
                would be presented with different artifacts representing the Gulf heritage. They can then click on these
                artifacts to be shown an overlay image with its respective description. In the NYU Abu Dhabi location,
                the user would be presented with a carousel view of various videos and pictures taken during class time
                which cover Khaleeji music and instruments that we have learned. It could also include recorded
                interviews of the professor, students, or guests that are willing to partake in our Khaleeji Heritage
                exploration. </p>
